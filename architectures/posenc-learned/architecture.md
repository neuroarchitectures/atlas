# Architecture: Learned Absolute Positions

## Motivation

A minimal decoder attention block where position information comes from a **learned absolute position embedding** added to the token embeddings. One trainable vector per position, summed into the input before attention. The scheme used by the original GPT and BERT.

**First of three sibling blocks** showing how position is injected: learned → RoPE → ALiBi. The graph diff is the whole point, here the position signal is a visible node in the main path (`pos_embed`) and attention itself is plain. See [COMPARISONS.md → Positional encoding](../../COMPARISONS.md#positional-encoding-learned--rope--alibi).

## Core Idea

A minimal decoder attention block where position information comes from a **learned absolute position embedding** added to the token embeddings.

| # | Layer | Type | Params |

| 4 | attn_norm | `layerNorm` | normalizedShape: 512 |

| 6 | residual | `add` |   |
| 7 | output | `output` |   |

Shape-validated end to end (passes Neurarch's shape propagation with zero errors).

### Design Notes

- Position lives in the **main path**: a `maxLen × embedDim` table added to the token embeddings, so attention needs no positional input.
- Trainable and simple, but capped at `maxLen` positions, this is the variant that does not extrapolate past its trained length, which is what motivated RoPE and ALiBi.
- Contrast with the [siblings](../../COMPARISONS.md#positional-encoding-learned--rope--alibi): in [posenc-rope](../posenc-rope/) and [posenc-alibi](../posenc-alibi/) the position node feeds the attention op instead of the residual stream.

## Implementation Notes

- `model.json` contains the full structural graph with real dimensions and parameters.
- Open in [Neurarch](https://www.neurarch.com/) to visualize, edit, or export training code.
- Diagrams fold repeated identical blocks with a `× N` badge; `model.json` holds all nodes at real dimensions.

## Limitations

- This package focuses on the architectural structure. Training pipelines, 
dataset preparation, and production optimizations are out of scope.
