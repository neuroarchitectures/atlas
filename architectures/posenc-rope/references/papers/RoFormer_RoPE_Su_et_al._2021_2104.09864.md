Abstract
Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.
Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:

Introduction
The sequential order of words is of great value to natural language understanding. Recurrent neural networks (RRNs) based models encode tokens’ order by recursively computing a hidden state along the time dimension. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) based models (CNNs)
Gehring et al. 2017
were typically considered position-agnostic, but recent work
Islam et al. 2020
has shown that the commonly used padding operation can implicitly learn position information.
Recently, the pre-trained language models (PLMs), which were built upon the transformer
Vaswani et al. 2017
, have achieved the state-of-the-art performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including context representation learning
Devlin et al. 2019
, machine translation
Vaswani et al. 2017
, and language modeling
Radford et al. 2019
, to name a few. Unlike, RRNs and CNNs-based models, PLMs utilize the self-attention mechanism to semantically capture the contextual representation of a given corpus. As a consequence, PLMs achieve a significant improvement in terms of parallelization over RNNs and improve the modeling ability of longer intra-token relations compared to CNNs

A stack of multiple CNN layers can also capture longer intra-token relation, here we only consider single layer setting.
.
It is noteworthy that the self-attention architecture of the current PLMs has shown to be position-agnostic
Yun et al. 2020
. Following this claim, various approaches have been proposed to encode the position information into the learning process. On one side, generated absolute position encoding through a pre-defined function
Vaswani et al. 2017
was added to the contextual representations, while a trainable absolute position encoding

focuses on relative position encoding, which typically encodes the relative position information into the attention mechanism. In addition to these approaches, the authors of
Liu et al. 2020
have proposed to model the dependency of position encoding from the perspective of Neural ODE
Chen et al. 2018a
, and the authors of
Wang et al. 2020
have proposed to model the position information in complex space. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position information to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the proposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.
Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark datasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better performance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE.
In brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:
•
We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly built based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation.
•
We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired for natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are not compatible with linear self-attention.
•
We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained language models are available on GitHub:
https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer
.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem in self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in

However, instead of directly adding the position to the context representation, RoPE proposes to incorporate the relative position information by multiplying with the sinusoidal functions.

followed these settings by only encoding the relative position information into the attention weights. However, the authors of

A comparison of the four variants of the relative position embeddings
Radford and Narasimhan 2018
has shown that the variant similar to
Equation
10
is the most efficient among the other three. Generally speaking, all these approaches attempt to modify
Equation
6
based on the decomposition of
Equation
3
under the self-attention settings in
Equation
2
, which was originally proposed in
Vaswani et al. 2017
. They commonly introduced to directly add the position information to the context representations. Unlikely, our approach aims to derive the relative position encoding from
Equation
1
under some constraints. Next, we show that the derived approach is more interpretable by incorporating relative position information with the rotation of context representations.

Proposed approach
In this section, we discuss the proposed rotary position embedding (RoPE). We first formulate the relative position encoding problem in
Section
3.1
, we then derive the RoPE in
Section
3.2
and investigate its properties in
Section
3.3
.
3.1
Formulation
Transformer-based language modeling usually leverages the position information of individual tokens through a self-attention mechanism. As can be observed in
Equation
2
,
𝒒
m
⊺
​
𝒌
n
{\boldsymbol{q}}_{m}^{\intercal}{\boldsymbol{k}}_{n}
typically enables knowledge conveyance between tokens at different positions. In order to incorporate relative position information, we require the inner product of query
𝒒
m
{\boldsymbol{q}}_{m}
and key
𝒌
n
{\boldsymbol{k}}_{n}
to be formulated by a function
g
g
, which takes only the word embeddings
𝒙
m
{\boldsymbol{x}}_{m}
,
𝒙
n
{\boldsymbol{x}}_{n}
, and their relative position
m
−
n
m-n
as input variables. In other words, we hope that the inner product encodes position information only in the relative form:
⟨
f
q
​
(
𝒙
m
,
m
)
,
f
k
​
(
𝒙
n

n
)

=
g
⁡
(

m

m
−
n
)
.
\langle f_{q}({\boldsymbol{x}}_{m},m),f_{k}({\boldsymbol{x}}_{n},n)\rangle=g({\boldsymbol{x}}_{m},{\boldsymbol{x}}_{n},m-n).
(11)
The ultimate goal is to find an equivalent encoding mechanism to solve the functions
f

f_{q}({\boldsymbol{x}}_{m},m)
and
f

f_{k}({\boldsymbol{x}}_{n},n)
to conform the aforementioned relation.

, applying matrix multiplication directly as in

is not computationally efficient; we provide another realization in theoretical explanation.
In contrast to the additive nature of position embedding method adopted in the previous works, i.e.,
Equations

and

Properties of RoPE
Long-term decay:
Following
Vaswani et al. 2017
, we set
θ
i
=
10000
−
2
i
/
d
\theta_{i}=10000^{-2i/d}
. One can prove that this setting provides a long-term decay property (refer to
Section
3.4.3
for more details), which means the inner-product will decay when the relative position increase. This property coincides with the intuition that a pair of tokens with a long relative distance should have less connection.
RoPE with linear attention:
The self-attention can be rewritten in a more general form.

Experiments and Evaluation
We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various NLP tasks as follows. We validate the performance of the proposed solution on machine translation task
Section
4.1
. Then, we compare our RoPE implementation with BERT
Devlin et al. 2019
during the pre-training stage in
Section
4.2
. Based on the pre-trained model, in
Section
4.3
, we further carry out evaluations across different downstream tasks from GLUE benchmarks
Singh et al. 2018
. In Addition, we conduct experiments using the proposed RoPE with the linear attention of PerFormer
Choromanski et al. 2020
in
Section
4.4
. By the end, additional tests on Chinese data are included in
Section
4.5
. All the experiments were run on two cloud severs with 4 x V100 GPUs.
4.1
Machine Translation
We first demonstrate the performance of RoFormer on sequence-to-sequence language translation tasks.
4.1.1
Experimental Settings
We choose the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset
Bojar et al. 2014
, which consists of approximately 4.5 million sentence pairs. We compare to the transformer-based baseline alternative
Vaswani et al. 2017
.
4.1.2
Implementation details
We carry out some modifications on self-attention layer of the baseline model
Vaswani et al. 2017
to enable RoPE to its learning process. We replicate the setup for English-to-German translation with a vocabulary of 37k based on a joint source and target byte pair encoding(BPE)
Sennrich et al. 2015
. During the evaluation, a single model is obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints. The result uses beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty 0.6. We implement the experiment in PyTorch in the fairseq toolkit (MIT License)
Ott et al. 2019
. Our model is optimized with the Adam optimizer using
β
1
=
0.9
\beta_{1}=0.9
,
β
2
=
0.98
\beta_{2}=0.98
, learning rate is increased linearly from

and then decayed proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. Label smoothing with 0.1 is also adopted. We report the BLEU
Papineni et al. 2002
score on the test set as the final metric.
4.1.3
Results
We train the baseline model and our RoFormer under the same settings and report the results in
Table
1
. As can be seen, our model gives better BLEU scores compared to the baseline Transformer.

Pre-training Language Modeling
The second experiment is to validate the performance of our proposal in terms of learning contextual representations. To achieve this, we replace the original sinusoidal position encoding of BERT with our RoPE during the pre-training step.
4.2.1
Experimental Settings
We use the BookCorpus
Zhu et al. 2015
and the Wikipedia Corpus
Foundation 2021
from Huggingface Datasets library (Apache License 2.0) for pre-training. The corpus is further split into train and validation sets at 8:2 ratio. We use the masked language-modeling (MLM) loss values of the training process as an evaluation metric.
The well-known BERT
Devlin et al. 2019
is adopted as our baseline model. Note that we use bert-base-uncased in our experiments.
4.2.2
Implementation details
For RoFormer, we replace the sinusoidal position encoding in the self-attention block of the baseline model with our proposed RoPE and realizes self-attention according to
Equation
16
. We train both BERT and RoFormer with batch size 64 and maximum sequence length of 512 for 100k steps. AdamW
Loshchilov and Hutter 2017
is used as the optimizer with learning rate 1e-5.
4.2.3
Results
The MLM loss during pre-training is shown on the left plot of
Figure
3
. Compare to the vanilla BERT, RoFormer experiences faster convergence.

4.3
Fine-tuning on GLUE tasks
Consistent with the previous experiments, we fine-tune the weights of our pre-trained RoFormer across various GLUE tasks in order to evaluate its generalization ability on the downstream NLP tasks.
4.3.1
Experimental Settings
We look at several datasets from GLUE, i.e. MRPC
Dolan and Brockett 2005
, SST-2
Socher et al. 2013
, QNLI
Rajpurkar et al. 2016
, STS-B
Al-Natsheh 2017
, QQP
Chen et al. 2018b
and MNLI
Williams et al. 2018
. We use F1-score for MRPC and QQP dataset, spearman correlation for STS-B, and accuracy for the remaining as the evaluation metrics.
4.3.2
Implementation details
We use Huggingface Transformers library (Apache License 2.0)
Wolf et al. 2020
to fine-tune each of the aforementioned downstream tasks for 3 epochs, with a maximum sequence length of 512, batch size of 32 and learning rates 2,3,4,5e-5. Following
Devlin et al. 2019
, we report the best-averaged results on the validation set.

Results
The evaluation results of the fine-tuning tasks are reported in
Table

. As can be seen, RoFormer can significantly outperform BERT in three out of six datasets, and the improvements are considerable.
4.4
Performer with RoPE
Performer
Choromanski et al. 2020
introduces an alternative attention mechanism, linear attention, which is designed to avoid quadratic computation cost that scales with input sequence length. As discussed in
Section
3.3
, the proposed RoPE can be easily implemented in the PerFormer model to realize the relative position encoding while keeping its linearly scaled complexity in self-attention. We demonstrate its performance with the pre-training task of language modeling.
4.4.1
Implementation details
We carry out tests on the Enwik8 dataset
Mahoney 2006
, which is from English Wikipedia that includes markup, special characters and text in other languages in addition to English text. We incorporate RoPE into the 12 layer char-based PerFormer with 768 dimensions and 12 heads
2
2
2
For this experiment, we adopt code (MIT License) from
https://github.com/lucidrains/performer-pytorch
.
To better illustrate the efficacy of RoPE, we report the loss curves of the pre-training process with and without RoPE under the same settings, i.e., learning rate 1e-4, batch size 128 and a fixed maximum sequence length of 1024, etc.
4.4.2
Results
As shown on the right plot of
Figure
3
, substituting RoPE into Performer leads to rapid convergence and lower loss under the same amount of training steps. These improvements, in addition to the linear complexity, make Performer more attractive.
4.5
Evaluation on Chinese Data
In addition to experiments on English data, we show additional results on Chinese data. To validate the performance of RoFormer on long texts, we conduct experiments on long documents whose length exceeds 512 characters.
4.5.1
Implementation
In these experiments, we carried out some modifications on WoBERT
Su 2020
by replacing the absolute position embedding with our proposed RoPE. As a cross-comparison with other pre-trained Transformer-based models in Chinese, i.e. BERT
Devlin et al. 2019
, WoBERT
Su 2020
, and NEZHA
Wei et al. 2019
, we tabulate their tokenization level and position embedding information in
Table

.

Pre-training
We pre-train RoFormer on approximately 34GB of data collected from Chinese Wikipedia, news and forums. The pre-training is carried out in multiple stages with changing batch size and maximum input sequence length in order to adapt the model to various scenarios. As shown in
Table
4
, the accuracy of RoFormer elevates with an increasing upper bound of sequence length, which demonstrates the ability of RoFormer in dealing with long texts. We claim that this is the attribute to the excellent generalizability of the proposed RoPE.

Downstream Tasks & Dataset
We choose Chinese AI and Law 2019 Similar Case Matching (CAIL2019-SCM)
Xiao et al. 2019
dataset to illustrate the ability of RoFormer in dealing with long texts, i.e., semantic text matching. CAIL2019-SCM contains 8964 triplets of cases published by the Supreme People’s Court of China. The input triplet, denoted as (A, B and C), are fact descriptions of three cases. The task is to predict whether the pair (A, B) is closer than (A, C) under a predefined similarity measure. Note that existing methods mostly cannot perform significantly on CAIL2019-SCM dataset due to the length of documents (i.e., mostly more than 512 characters). We split train, validation and test sets based on the well-known ratio 6:2:2.
4.5.4
Results
We apply the pre-trained RoFormer model to CAIL2019-SCM with different input lengths. The model is compared with the pre-trained BERT and WoBERT model on the same pre-training data, as shown in
Table
5
. With short text cut-offs, i.e., 512, the result from RoFormer is comparable to WoBERT and is slightly better than the BERT implementation. However, when increasing the maximum input text length to 1024, RoFormer outperforms WoBERT by an absolute improvement of 1.5%.

Limitations of the work
Although we provide theoretical groundings as well as promising experimental justifications, our method is limited by following facts:
•
Despite the fact that we mathematically format the relative position relations as rotations under 2D sub-spaces, there lacks of thorough explanations on why it converges faster than baseline models that incorporates other position encoding strategies.
•
Although we have proved that our model has favourable property of long-term decay for intern-token products,
Section
3.3
, which is similar to the existing position encoding mechanisms, our model shows superior performance on long texts than peer models, we have not come up with a faithful explanation.
Our proposed RoFormer is built upon the Transformer-based infrastructure, which requires hardware resources for pre-training purpose.
5
Conclusions
In this work, we proposed a new position embedding method that incorporates explicit relative position dependency in self-attention to enhance the performance of transformer architectures. Our theoretical analysis indicates that relative position can be naturally formulated using vector production in self-attention, with absolution position information being encoded through a rotation matrix. In addition, we mathematically illustrated the advantageous properties of the proposed method when applied to the Transformer. Finally, experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method encourages faster convergence in pre-training. The experimental results also show that our proposed RoFormer can achieve better performance on long texts task.
