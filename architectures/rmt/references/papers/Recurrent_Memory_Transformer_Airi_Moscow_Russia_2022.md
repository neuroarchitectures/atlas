                                                 Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and
                                                 tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements
                                                 into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to
                                                 be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length
                                                 of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-
                                                 attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level
                                                 recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global
                                                 information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence
                                                 with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes
                                                 to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output se-
                                                 quence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence
                                                 representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on
                                                 par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes
                                                 and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show
                                                 that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This
                                                 makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications
                                                 that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory
                                                 processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.


                                        1    Introduction
                                        Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have been widely
                                        adopted across multiple domains and tasks (Radford
                                        et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019;
                                        Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2021; Jaegle
                                        et al., 2021). The key component of Transformer
                                        layer is a self-attention. Self-attention allows to up-
                                        date each sequence element representation with in-
                                        formation from all other elements in the sequence.

input sequence length that hurts its applications to long inputs (Child et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019;
Dai et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020;
Choromanski et al., 2020).
Our work introduces a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer named Recurrent
Memory Transformer (RMT). RMT uses a memory mechanism based on special memory tokens (Burt-
sev et al., 2020) added to the input sequence. Memory tokens provide additional reserved capacity to
the model that could be used to process information which is not directly representing any element in
the input sequence. To process long sequences, we split them into segments and pass memory states
from a previous to a current segment. This memory passing makes the model recurrent and removes
the input sequence length limitations. RMT model can theoretically work with infinite lengths but, in
practice, it is limited by memory capacity and the efficiency of memory access/update operations.
Our implementation of both memory and recurrence in RMT requires no changes to the Transformer
model because modifications are made only to the input and output sequences of the model.
We tested RMT on the tasks that require global information about the whole input sequence to be
solved. We use copy, reverse, and associative retrieval tasks in the setting where the input sequence
is split into segments. RMT and Transformer-XL perfectly solve these tasks, but exceeding some
value of sequence length, RMT starts to outperform Transformer-XL. Also, we experimentally show
that the proposed Recurrent Memory Transformer requires less memory size to perform closely to
Transformer-XL on language modeling tasks. RMT code and experiments are available1 .
Contributions
1. In this study we augment Transformer with token based memory storage and segment-level
recurrence.
2. We experimentally evaluate proposed architecture as well as vanilla Transformer and Transformer-
XL on memory-intensive tasks such as copy, reverse, associative retrieval, and language modeling.
We show that RMT outperforms Transformer-XL for sequence processing tasks and on par with
Transformer-XL on language modeling but requires less memory.
3. We show that Tr-XL cache could be combined with RMT leading to better performance on
language modeling.
4. We analysed how the Transformer model learns to use memory. Specific interpretable memory
read-write patterns of attention are shown.


2       Related work

In our study we add a memory to general purpose attention based neural architecture. Memory is
a recurrent topic in neural networks research. It had started from the early works (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943; Stephen, 1956) and significantly progressed in 90’s with introduction of Backpropagation
Through Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter
and Schmidhuber, 1997) neural architecture. Today memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs)
usually rely on some kind of recurrent external-memory which is separate from the model’s pa-
rameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Weston
et al., 2014) are equipped with a storage for vector representations that can be accessed with an
attention mechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed
to enable reasoning by sequential attention over to the content of a memory. NTMs followed by
Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNC (Rae et al., 2016)
are implemented as recurrent neural networks able to write to memory storage over time. All these
models are differentiable and can be trained via backpropagation through time (BPTT). Parallel line
of research extends recurrent neural networks such as LSTM with data structures like stacks, lists,
or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015). MANN architectures with a more
advanced addressing mechanisms such as address-content separation and multi-step addressing were
proposed in (Gulcehre et al., 2016, 2017; Meng and Rumshisky, 2018). The Global Context Layer
model (Meng and Rumshisky, 2018) uses the idea of address-content separation to solve the difficulty
of training content-based addressing in the canonical NTM.

The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory
architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of
hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache
to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al.,
2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores
information from the cache. ∞-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and
represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory
Layers (Lample et al., 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer
within Transformer block to increase model capacity.
In many variations of Transformer different sorts of global representations are added. Among them
are Star-Transformer (Guo et al., 2019), Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), GMAT (Gupta and Berant,
2020), Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) (Ainslie et al., 2020) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al.,
2020). All these architectures re-design self-attention mechanism to reduce it computational com-
plexity with and ensure input coverage with the help of global representations. Memory Transformer
(Burtsev et al., 2020) keeps Transformer model intact and adds memory by extending input sequence
with special memory tokens. Perceiver IO (Jaegle et al., 2021) maps an entire arbitrary input to the
fixed number of latent representations. Transformer layers do further processing over latent memory
representations only.
Segment-level recurrence in Transformers is actively explored in a number of studies. Transformer-
XL, Compressive Transformer keep previous states and re-use them in subsequent segments. Ernie-
Doc (Ding et al., 2021) improves processing by using same-layer recurrence instead of attending to
previous layer outputs of a precedent segment. Memformer (Wu et al., 2020) introduces a dedicated
memory module to keep previous hidden states in summarized representations. Memformer uses two
special layers added to the Transformer model. Memory cross-attention layer reads from memory
and memory slot attention layer updates it. MART (Lei et al., 2020) has a similar approach as
Memformer but uses memory update rules analogous to LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)
and GRU (Cho et al., 2014). FeedBack Transformer (Fan et al., 2020) goes further with full, and not
segment-level, recurrence. FeedBack Memory merges past hidden representations from all layers
into a single vector and makes it accessible to the computations at any layer. The disadvantage of full
recurrence is that it is less parallelizable. FeedBack Memory requires every sequence element to be
processed sequentially. In segment-level recurrent models, all elements of a segment are processed by
Transformer layers in parallel. Only segments are processed sequentially. Staircase Transformer (Ju
et al., 2021) combines segment-level recurrence and depth recurrence. Staircase models use the
output for previous segments and pass them as input for the next segment. Our Recurrent Memory
Transformer is based on special memory tokens similar to Memory Transformer, segment-level
recurrence as in Transformer-XL, and depth-recurrent mechanism for memory processing similar to
Staircase.

3   Recurrent Memory Transformer
Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) extends Transformer model with state re-use cache mechanism
for segment-level recurrence and relative position encoding. Input sequence is split on segments
processed sequentially. Hidden states computed for the previous segment M n are cached for each
transformer layer n. The input of the layer n consists of the last m states from the cached memory
and output of previous Transformer layer for the current segment τ :
                                                n−1
                                  H̃τn−1 = [SG(M−m: ) ◦ Hτn−1 ],
here, SG stands for stop-gradient, ◦ denotes concatenation. Cached states allow to increase effective
context size of Transformer model and save on compute operations.
Then, H̃τn−1 goes to Transformer layer T L to produce layer n outputs for segment τ :
         Hτn = T L(Qnτ , Kτn , Vτn ), Qnτ = Wqn Hτn−1 ; Kτn = Wkn H̃τn−1 , Vτn = Wvn H̃τn−1 .
In Transformer-XL, self-attention layers are modified to use relative position encodings to improve
generalization to longer attention lengths. The overall architecture is shown in the Figure 2.
Memory augmented Transformers such as GMAT, ETC, Memory Transformer (Gupta and Berant,
2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Burtsev et al., 2020) proposed to use special global tokens as storage

Figure 2: Comparison of Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) and Transformer-XL architectures.
Recurrent Memory Transformer augments Transformer with global memory tokens and passes them to allow a
segment-level recurrence. Special read/write memory tokens are added to the input sequence. Multiple memory
tokens can be used in each read/write block. Updated representations of write memory are passed to the next
segment. During training, RMT uses BPTT to propagate gradient to previous segments through memory tokens
representation. Effective context length for recurrence with memory is not limited by the depth of a network
which is the case for the cache of Transformer-XL.
for representations. Usually, memory tokens are added to the beginning of the input sequence.
However, in decoder-only architectures the causal attention mask makes impossible for memory
tokens at the start of the sequence to collect information from the subsequent tokens. On the other
hand, if memory tokens are placed at the end of the sequence then preceding tokens unable to
access their representations. To solve this problem we add a recurrence to the sequence processing.
Representations of memory tokens placed at the end of the segment are used as an input memory
representations at the start as well as at the end of the next segment.
In the Recurrent Memory Transformer input is augmented with special [mem] tokens, processed in
a standard way along with the sequence of tokens. Each memory token is a real-valued vector. m
memory tokens are added at the beginning of the segment tokens representations Hτ0 and the same m
tokens are added at the end:
    H̃τ0 = [Hτmem ◦ Hτ0 ◦ Hτmem ], H̄τN = Transformer(H̃τ0 ), [Hτread ◦ HτN ◦ Hτwrite ] := H̄τN ,
here N is a number of Transformer layers.
The starting group of memory tokens functions as a read memory that allows sequence tokens to
attend to memory states produced at the previous segment. The ending group works as a write
memory that can attend to all current segment tokens and update representation stored in the memory.
As a result, Hτwrite contains updated memory tokens for the segment τ .
Segments of the input sequence are processed sequentially. To enable recurrent connection between
segments, we pass outputs of the memory tokens from the current segment to the input of the next
segment:
                      Hτmem
                         +1 := Hτ
                                  write
                                        , H̃τ0+1 = [Hτmem     0       mem
                                                       +1 ◦ Hτ +1 ◦ Hτ +1 ].

Both memory and recurrence in the RMT are based only on global memory tokens. It allows to
keep the backbone Transformer unchanged and make RMT memory augmentation compatible with
any model from the Transformer family. Memory tokens operate only on the input and output of
the model. In this study we implement RMT on top of the original Transformer-XL code. Both
architectures are shown in Figure 2.
Recurrence in the RMT is different compared to the Transformer-XL because the former stores only
m memory vectors per segment. On the other hand, the Transformer-XL stores m × N vectors per
segment. Also, in the RMT model memory representations from the previous segment are processed
by Transformer layers together with the current segment tokens. This makes memory part of RMT
effectively deeper in a number of applied Transformer layers τ × N . Additionally, we allow all
memory tokens in the read/write block to access all other tokens in the same block. The causal
attention mask is applied only to tokens of the input sequence (Figure 6(d)).
We train the RMT with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). During backward pass, unlike in
Transformer-XL, memory gradients are not stopped between segments. The number of previous
segments to backpropagate is a hyperparameter of a training procedure. We vary BPTT unroll in our
experiments from 0 to 4 previous segments. Increasing this parameter is computationally expensive


                                                     4
and requires a lot of GPU RAM. However, techniques such as gradient checkpointing could be used
to alleviate this problem.


4       Experiments

We designed our experiments to evaluate the ability of Recurrent Memory Transformers to preserve
long-term dependencies across multiple input segments. The first set of experiments includes copy,
reverse, associative retrieval, and quadratic equations tasks. The second one addresses language
modeling task for word-level on WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2017) and for character-level on
enwik8 (Mahoney, 2006). We compare Recurrent Memory Transformer with Transformer and
Transformer-XL models.
Our RMT implementation is based on Transformer-XL repository2 . The full set of hyperparameters
is available in our repository as well as in supplementary materials. Language modeling experiments
follow the same model and training hyperparameters as Transformer-XL. WikiText-103 experiments
use 16-layer Transformers (10 heads, 410 hidden size, 2100 intermediate FF), enwik8 – 12 layer
Transformers (8 heads, 512 hidden size, 2048 intermediate FF). We used Adam optimizer Kingma and
Ba (2015) with linear schedule learning rate starting from 0.00025 for 200,000 steps for WikiText-103
and 400,000 steps for enwik8. We refer to Transformer-XL with memory size equal to zero as a
Baseline. With this experimental setup we were able to reproduce results for the Transformer-XL
model close to the original paper.
Algorithmic Tasks. We evaluate RMT on algorithmic tasks that require information about the whole
input sequence to be solved successfully. In a recurrent setting, the model has to keep information
about all previous segments to make predictions.
In the Copy task, an input sequence should be replicated twice after a special start-to-generate token.
In the Reverse task, an input sequence should be generated in a reverse order. Input for the Associative
Retrieval task consists of N key-value pairs. Then one key is randomly selected, and the task is to
produce an appropriate value for the selected key. Another task is to solve quadratic equations. One
example consists of an equation, its solution with discriminant, and an answer. The task is to generate
a solution and answer, while only answer quality is evaluated.
For all tasks, input and output sequences are split into segments and processed by models sequentially.
Datasets for algorithmic tasks were randomly pre-generated, the same data was used in all experiments,
and character-level tokenization was used. Because Transformer-XL and RMT are decoder-only
Transformer models, we don’t compute loss over the input sequence before the start-to-generate
token. The loss is computed over target sequence segments only (see Appendix A.1 for details).
Language Modeling and NLP. We use two standard benchmarks for language modeling: WikiText-
103 and enwik8. WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2017) is used for word-level language modeling
and contains 103M words from English Wikipedia articles. Enwik8 (Mahoney, 2006) is used for
character-level and consists of 108 first bytes of XML text dump of the English Wikipedia. Vocabulary
contains 267735 words and 204 characters for Wikitext-103 and enwik8 tokenizers accordingly.
We compare Recurrent Memory Transformer with decoder-only Transformer and Transformer-XL
as baselines. Model size and training parameters are selected to match Transformer-XL paper. For
Wikitext-103 an input context length was set to 150 tokens, and for enwik8 it was set to 512 characters.
Another set of experiments inspected how RMT handles long-term dependencies and recurrence. We
increased the number of segments and recurrent steps by making segments smaller (50 tokens for
WikiText-103, 128 characters for enwik8). The increased number of recurrent steps makes language
modeling tasks harder for RMT because information has to be stored in the same amount of memory
for more steps.
As a testbed for the real-life application scenario we select popular long-text classification benchmark
Hyperpartisan news (Kiesel et al., 2019). Instead of pre-training RMT from scratch we add recurrent
memory mechanism to the most widely adopted models from HuggingFace Transformers (Wolf et al.,
2020). Specifically, we augment 500 input tokens of already pretrained BERT-base, RoBERTa-base,
DeBERTa-base and T5-base with the recurrent memory of size 10 and fine-tune on the target task.

5    Results
Baseline, Transformer-XL (Tr-XL) and RMT perform perfectly in the single segment setting on copy
and reverse tasks (Figure 3). In this case, the models do not need recurrence because the whole
sequence is available. When the number of segments is larger than one, non-recurrent baseline
struggles to solve tasks, but both memory models demonstrate ability to retain required information
from the previous segments in memory.




Figure 3: RMT outperforms Transformer-XL on Copy and Reverse tasks as a number of segments
increases. Panels show test set per-character accuracy on copy, reverse, and associative retrieval tasks (from left
to right). Memory/cache size equals to the length of a segment for both models. RMT does not pass gradients
between segments in this experiment. MT results are the same as for the Baseline. Source/target sequence
lengths for copy, reverse, and associative retrieval tasks: 24/48, 24/24, 10/1.
On Copy and Reverse tasks as a number of segments increases, RMT starts to outperform Transformer-
XL with memory sizes less than the number of all previous tokens. With the number of segments
up to 6 mean accuracy of Transformer-XL drops by up to 0.2 points, and with 9 segments plunges
close to the baseline without memory. Associative Retrieval results are similar with the number of
segments up to 4. RMT manages to solve the task with Transformer-XL closely behind. However,
in the setting with 5 segments, RMT performance slightly decreases and Transformer-XL average
accuracy rises higher.
We analyze how a number of segments, sequence length, a length of training context, and memory
size affect models’ performance on Copy task (Figure 4). As we split a sequence into more segments
it becomes more crucial to be able to pass information between segments. We split 360 tokens of
source + target sequence into multiple segments. In Figure 4a we observe that Transformer-XL
performance starts to degrade and eventually falls to the baseline model performance as the number of
segments increases. In contrast, RMT continues to solve the task perfectly. In a more extreme setting,
when we keep memory size fixed, but increase the total length of a sequence to copy Transformer-XL
fails shortly, while RMT starts to gradually degrade only after the length of 720 tokens (Figure 4b).
On the Quadratic Equations task (Table 1) we have checked that it is possible to solve the task with
the Transformer baseline and no segmentation used. The baseline in this case defines upper bound for
this task. With multiple segments recurrency RMT solves the task perfectly, while Transformer-XL
finds the task challenging.

memory size 10 and 25 show similar performance as Transformer-XL with a memory size equal to
75. RMT learns to use smaller memory more effectively than Transformer-XL. Additionally, the
smaller memory size of RMT leads to reducing required GPU memory for running the model.
To force models to process longer recurrent dependencies the size of a segment is set to 50, so the
number of recurrent steps increases. RMT with memory size 1 shows similar results to Transformer-

similar perplexity values (see Appendix A.5).
RMT could be combined with Tr-XL cache. In this case Tr-XL cache could be seen as short-term
memory keeping the nearest context and RMT memory as long-term memory. Such combination
leads to the best results on WikiText-103 improving over Tr-XL.

compressed states (50, 100, 200) from previous segments. In general, training RMT with unrolling
gradients in earlier segments drastically improves scores thus showing the importance of BPTT
training but, we observe instabilities and out-of-memory issues during RMT training for a larger
memory sizes with deeper BPTT unrolls.
RMT wins a lot when only one memory token is added but then the effect from increasing memory
size from 5 to 50 fades (Figure 5b). Still, RMT with memory size 5 have performance on par with
Transformer-XL with cache 50, confirming that RMT learns to store more compact representations.
The results suggest that there is some optimal memory size for RMT to solve the task, and further
increase does not add much.
Proposed recurrent memory mechanism affects only input and gradient flows of the augmented core
model. This might be an important advantage because the memory can be added to already pretrained

to itself, but the bottom diagonal represents the operation of writing of sequence tokens to memory in
straight order. When completing reverse (fig.6(a) bottom) the model learns to write the sequence to
the memory in the reversed order, which is in line with common sense.
When it comes to reproducing the target sequence, the model accesses memory (fig.6(b)) and writes
to the output sequence. Another operation (fig.6(c)) is rewriting from read memory to write memory.
It is commonly used by RMT in settings with larger number of segments to keep information about
recent segments longer.
Transformer-XL mechanism of accessing memory (fig.6(d)) does not allow straightforward writing
to memory without changing sequence token representations. Sequential reading from cache is
represented by diagonals on Transformer-XL attention maps. Using token representations as storage
harms model performance in tasks with larger number of segments. For reverse task with 4 segments
Transformer-XL with limited memory size 6 (Appendix B Figure 9(b)) attempts to mix representations
of tokens and read multiple symbols from one cached state in the next segments giving average
accuracy of 0.8 on the target task. Despite having the same memory size, RMT manages to compress
the whole segment in memory tokens (Appendix B Figure 9(a)) and achieve mean accuracy 1.
Visualizations from Figure 6 and Appendix B Figure 9 provide evidence to support our hypotheses
that Tr-XL has to mix representations from previous and current segments in the same hidden states
to pass information between segments. Also, visualizations show how memory tokens in RMT help

Appendix A.1 Figure 8. For copy with 6 segments RMT compresses and then reads the sequence
of 12 tokens with just 6 memory tokens. For Transformer-XL decreasing memory size harms the
accuracy score significantly with number of segments larger than 2.

6   Conclusions
In this paper we introduced Recurrent Memory Transformer a simple recurrent memory augmentation
of Transformer model. RMT is implemented by extension of an input sequence with special global
memory tokens and segment-level recurrence. Importantly, our method allows to learn more compact
sequence representations and improve existing pretrained models without extensive additional com-
pute, thus making practical machine learning applications more energy efficient and environmentally
friendly.
In our experiments we compared RMT with Transformer baseline and Transformer-XL which
is a well-known modification of Transformer for long sequences. RMT almost perfectly solves
Copy, Reverse as well as quadratic equations tasks for sequences consisting of multiple segments
outperforming Transformer-XL. It also demonstrates quality for associative retrieval task on par
with Transformer-XL. As expected, baseline Transformer fails to solve these tasks for multi-segment
settings.
RMT trained as a language model performs significantly ahead of Transformer baseline and shows
quality metrics similar to Transformer-XL but for up to 10 times smaller memory size. Experimental
results demonstrate that for fixed memory size backpropagating gradients for more segments improves
performance of RMT. Proposed approach to memory augmentation is quite universal and might be
easily applied to any pretrained transformer based model as demonstrated by achievement of state of
the art results for long text classification task by fine tuning a combination of RoBERTa and RMT.
Analysis of attention maps suggests that better RMT performance can be related to more effective
storage of input representations in dedicated memory tokens compared to mixing representations
storage in Transformer-XL. RMT could be combined with Transformer-XL cache and improve the
performance of both models.
Overall, results of the study show that dedicated memory storage and recurrence provided by
Recurrent Memory Transformer make it a promising architecture for applications that require learning
of long-term dependencies and general purpose in-memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and
reasoning. Furthermore, we believe that RMT could open the way for adding memory and recurrence
to other models in the Transformer family.

A     Training details and additional results

A.1   Algorithmic tasks

Datasets were randomly generated by uniformly sampling tokens from dictionary into task sequences
and generating targets accordingly to the tasks. After generation, datasets are fixed for all experiments.
Copy and reverse use sequences of sizes 24, 40, 120, 240, and 360, making total copy/reverse
input length 48/72, 80/120, 240/360, 480/720, 720/1080. The associative retrieval task consists of 4
key-value pairs and one randomly selected key; the answer consists of one value. Train, validation
and test sizes of copy 24, reverse 24 and associative retrieval datasets are 100000, 5000 and 10000.
Transformer-XL had the same cache size on training and validation to match RMT.
For training all models on copy and reverse, we used constant learning rate 1e-4 with reduction on
plateau with decay factor of 0.5. Copy and reverse were solved by models with 4 layers and 4 heads,
associative retrieval models had 6 layers and 4 heads. Models with the same context size and memory
size were trained for the same number of steps and the same training parameters.
Experiments with sequence length 24 were conducted on a single Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPU from 1
hour to 2-3 days. Copy and reverse on longer sequence lengths were done on more powerful Tesla
V100 using 1-3 devices with training time varying from 1 hour to 3-4 days.




Figure 7: Reverse task in one and four segments setting for decoder-only models. Dotted lines show
segment borders.




Figure 8: RMT scales better with limited memory size. Test set per-character accuracy on copy (a), reverse
with a sequence length 24 (b) and 120 (c). Memory size is set to a half of the segment size. RMT solves the
tasks almost perfectly with limited memory unlike Tr-XL.




                                                    14
A.2    Associative retrieval

We used code for the task dataset generation from (Ba et al., 2016)3 .

A.3    Quadratic equations

This dataset consists of equations with integer coefficients and step-by-step solutions using the
discriminant. Process of equation generation is started from uniformly sampling real roots x1 , x2
from -100 to 100. The answer of an equation is represented as x1 , x2 . Next, we find the equation as
multiplication of two parentheses (x − x1 )(x − x2 ) = 0, which is expanded to x2 − (x1 + x2 )x +
x1 x2 = 0. Next, we multiply all coefficients by a random natural number α from 1 to 10. The final
equation form is αx2 − α(x1 + x2 )x + αx1 x2 = 0. A dataset sample is made of these stages in
reversed order. We also provide a string with the discriminant calculation to help find the equation
roots. 20 percent of equations in the dataset do not have real roots.
Example equation string:
-4*xˆ2+392*x-2208=0,
solution string:
xˆ2-98*x+552=0;D=98ˆ2-4*1*552=7396=86ˆ2;x=(98-86)/2=6;x=(98+86)/2=92 ,
and answer:
6,92
Each solution step is tokenized on char level and padded to the length of 30 tokens. The total length
of each training sample is 180, the dataset has 100000 training, 10000 validation and 20000 test
samples.
For this task we used models with 6 layers, 6 heads and segment sizes 180 and 30. The training was
performed with the same schedule as copy and reverse on a single GTX 1080 ti for 1-2 days. Memory
size for RMT and Transformer-XL was chosen equal to the segment length.

A.4    Enwik8

We verified our experimental setup by reproducing Transformer-XL results on enwik8 dataset
(Table 4). We used 12-layer Baseline (Transformer), Transformer-XL, RMT in all enwik8 experiments.
All results on enwik8 dataset are in Table 4. We used 2 NVIDIA A100 80Gb GPUs, training time
varied from 10 to 30 hours depending on sequence length, memory size, and number of BPTT unrolls.

A.5    WikiText-103

We used 16-layer models in all experiments on WikiText-103 dataset. Training hyperparameters
were used from (Dai et al., 2019) and authors PyTorch scripts4 . All results on WikiText-103 dataset
are in Table 5. In most of the WikiText-103 experiments, we used 2 NVIDIA A100 80Gb GPUs,
training time varied from 10 to 30 hours depending on sequence length, memory size, and number
of BPTT unrolls. All models except the ones noted with 2x steps were trained for 200k batches.
Transformer-XL did not benefit from longer training unlike the Tr-XL + RMT model. For training
the combined model we used an auxiliary loss for memory tokens, it was added to the main loss with
a multiplier of 0.01. We set a new fixed special token to be predicted from memory as target in the
auxiliary loss.

B   Operations with Memory




Figure 9: Approaches to compression and decompression of sequence with length 12 and memory
with size 6. (a) - RMT, (b) - Transformer-XL. Tr-XL mixes representations of tokens and reads
multiple symbols from one cached state. RMT manages to compress the whole segment into memory
tokens.
